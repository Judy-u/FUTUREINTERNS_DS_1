 Task 3 – Student Feedback Analysis

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student feedback survey data to understand overall satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement. The dataset primarily consisted of numerical rating responses rather than detailed text feedback, which reflects many real-world academic and event feedback scenarios.

The objective was to transform these numeric responses into meaningful insights using data analysis and visualization techniques.

 Dataset
- Source: Student feedback survey dataset (Kaggle-style survey data)
- Type: Numeric ratings across multiple satisfaction-related questions
- Challenge: Limited qualitative feedback, requiring thoughtful aggregation and interpretation of numerical scores

Methodology
- Cleaned and organized the dataset using Pandas
- Aggregated multiple rating dimensions to compute an overall satisfaction score
- Categorized students into:
  - Satisfied
  - Neutral
  - Unsatisfied
  based on defined rating thresholds
- Visualized satisfaction distribution and rating trends
- Designed a one-page dashboard for clear presentation of insights

Key Insights
- Average overall rating: 5.6 / 10  
- 78% of students reported a neutral experience  
- 18% of students were satisfied  
- 4% of students were unsatisfied  

These results highlight opportunities to improve engagement, delivery, and overall student experience.

Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab
- Canva (for dashboard design)

 Learning Outcome
This task demonstrated that even when feedback is mostly numeric, valuable insights can still be derived through proper aggregation, visualization, and interpretation. It strengthened my ability to work with real-world survey data and present findings in a clear, professional manner.
